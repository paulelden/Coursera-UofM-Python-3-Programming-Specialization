# Coursera-UofM-Python-3-Programming-Specialization

A collection of project files I created as part of this course program. None of the filenames used in these projects are files that I hold or own, they are the property of the University of Michigan, Coursera, Runestone, or their respective owner(s). As such, any file(s) run from this repository that use external files will not run correctly.

These projects represent the knowledge and skills I have acquired from Coursera's Python3 Programming Specialization, administered by the University of Michigan. It emphasizes data science topics and OOP.

If you are using this repository to copy the answers to the course(s), please make sure you understand what the code means before you submit your answers.
